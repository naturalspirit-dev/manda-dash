			"name": "First Port of Entry",
			"description": "A port where a vessel may enter and clear foreign goods and personnel through Customs and Immigration. For vessels arriving from overseas a quarantine clearance is required by the First Port of Entry."

		{
			"name": "Chart",
			"description": "The number of the best-scale chart issued by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is listed with no prefix."
		},
		{
			"name": "Harbor Size",
			"description": "The classification of harbor size is based on several applicable factors, including area, facilities, and wharf space. It is not based on area alone or on any other single factor."
		},
		{
			"name": "Publication",
			"description": "Each port and place listed in the text of this publication is numbered consecutively. Only the approved index number and name will appear in this list. Ports and places can be located by referring to the alphabetical index to find the index number. In cases where there is an alternate and/or more familiar name, that name will have the same index number. The page number will not be listed."
		},
		{
			"name": "Harbor Type",
			"description": "The term “harbor” is used for the principal water area of the port. Harbors are classified as being coastal natural, coastal breakwater, open roadstead, etc. Typical harbor types are illustrated in the forepart of this volume."
		},
		{
			"name": "Shelter",
			"description": "The shelter afforded from wind, sea, and swell, refers to the area where normal port operations are conducted, usually the wharf area. Shelter afforded the anchorage area is given for ports where cargo is handled by lighters."
		},
		{
			"name": "Overhead Limit",
			"description": "This entry is shown only to indicate that bridge and overhead power cables exist. It is advisable to refer to the chart for particulars."
		},
		{
			"name": "Channel",
			"description": "The controlling depth of the principal or deepest channel at chart datum is given. The channel selected should lead up to the anchorage if within the harbor or to the wharf/pier. If the channel depth decreases from the anchorage to the wharf/pier and cargo can be worked at the anchorage, then the depth leading to the anchorage is taken. Large ports may have sub-ports (smaller) which have their own number and entry in the World Port Index. The controlling depth of the channel should refer to a smaller channel (if present) leading from the main channel into the sub-port facilities and anchorages. Note.—The depth of small shoals is not a controlling depth unless it limits the passage of vessels. For example, if a channel is charted as having a depth of 39 feet (11.9 meters), but there are small shoals noted or charted with depths of 30 feet (9.1 meters), then the controlling depth is still 39 feet (11.9 meters) unless a ship with a draft of 39 feet (11.9 meters) cannot pass around the shoals and navigate the channel safely."
		},
		{
			"name": "Anchorage",
			"description": "The depth in the anchorage is the least depth in the best or principal anchorage. The depth listed reflects a general depth in the anchorage rather than an isolated shoal spot. A shoal which does not necessarily obstruct the anchorage is not considered for the least depth if the rest of the anchorage is safe and practicable."
		},
		{
			"name": "Cargo Pier",
			"description": "The greatest depth at chart datum alongside the respective wharf/pier is given. If there is more than one wharf/pier, then the one which has the greatest usable depth is shown. For example, if there are three cargo/container piers with depths of 23 feet (7.0 meters), 33 feet (10.1 meters), and 43 feet (13.1 meters), then Code H, representing the deepest depth of 43 feet (13.1 meters), would be entered into the World Port Index."
		},
		{
			"name": "Oil Terminal",
			"description": "The greatest depth at chart datum will be shown. Note: an oil terminal is a facility designed to conduct the loading and/or off-loading of crude oil or refined petroleum products. The terminal can be associated with a port or can be a stand alone facility. Generally, the terminal is offshore and is connected to the shore facilities by a pipeline. The offshore part may be an extended pier, SBM, buoy field, platform, or storage tanker. Many ports have piers and/or wharves that have facilities for refueling vessels. The oil terminal is distinguished by being specifically for oil transfer operations and nothing else (repairs alongside and cargo operations not permitted)."
		},
		{
			"name": "Tide",
			"description": "The mean range in meters is normally given for all ports outside of United States (U.S.) jurisdiction, but the mean rise is substituted if range data is not available. The distinction between range and rise can be disregarded without affecting the general utility of this publication."
		},
		{

			"name": "Ship Repairs",
			"description": "Repairs that can be made to ocean-going vessels are classified, as follows: Major – Extensive overhauling and rebuilding in well equipped shipyards.

		{
			"name": "Decimal Degree Coordinates",
			"description": "Decimal degrees (DD) express latitude and longitude geographic coordinates as decimal fractions of a degree. DD are used in many geographic information systems (GIS), web mapping applications such as OpenStreetMap, and GPS devices. Decimal degrees are an alternative to using sexagesimal degrees."
		},
		{
			"name": "Mediterranean Mooring",
			"description": "Mediterranean mooring, often called 'Med mooring' for short, is a technique that got its name from the region where it's common practice. Rather than coming alongside a slip or pier beam-to, boats tie stern-to, at a right angle to the quay or dock. This is default in Mediterranean harbours, as it is in most places with no appreciable range of tide. The availability of such conditions are listed."
